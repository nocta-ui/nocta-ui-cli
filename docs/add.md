# `nocta-ui add`

## Overview
`add` installs one or more UI components from the Nocta registry into the workspaces defined by your `nocta.config.json`. It downloads source files, writes them to the correct packages, normalises imports, and installs any npm dependencies that are required.

```bash
npx @nocta-ui/cli add button card avatar

npx @nocta-ui/cli add dialog --dry-run
```

## Prerequisites
- A valid `nocta.config.json` in the current directory (run `nocta-ui init` first).
- Tailwind CSS tokens inserted by `init` (optional but recommended).
- Network access to fetch the registry manifest, component source files, and helper assets.

## Command Options
| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--dry-run` | Outputs every planned file write and dependency action without touching the filesystem or running package managers. |
| `--help` | Displays usage help. |

Component names are case-insensitive. You can pass multiple names in one run; the CLI resolves internal dependencies automatically.

## How Component Resolution Works
1. Fetch the latest registry manifest and build a lookup table for slugs and display names.
2. For each requested component, load its metadata plus internal dependencies (if component A depends on B, both are installed automatically).
3. Use the metadata `files[].target` value to determine which workspace should receive each file:
   - If the file targets a linked shared UI workspace, the CLI writes directly into that workspace.
   - Files without an explicit target go to the primary workspace configured in `nocta.config.json`.
4. Component source files are fetched individually from the registry and normalised before writing (import prefixes, alias adjustments, flattening of folder structures, etc.).

## File Placement & Import Normalisation
- Files are written relative to the `aliases.components` and `aliases.utils` paths defined in the config.
- Imports that used the registry’s default `@/` prefix are rewritten to match your configured alias. React Router projects default to `~/`.
- When a linked workspace exposes a custom import alias (`aliases.components.import`), the CLI emits imports using that alias.
- Existing files trigger a prompt. You can decline to cancel the run, or accept to overwrite. Dry runs list the conflicts but never prompt.

## Export Barrels
- If a workspace defines `exports.components` in its `nocta.config.json`, `nocta-ui add` keeps the referenced barrel file in sync.
- New components are appended as named re-exports (`export { Button } from "./components/ui/button";`) inside a marked section so you can still add custom code above or below.
- Dry runs preview the statements that would be added without touching disk.
- Shared UI workspaces initialised with the current CLI default to `src/index.ts`, allowing consumers to import from the package root immediately.

## Dependency Management
- Dependencies declared in the registry (for example `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, `class-variance-authority`, `@ariakit/react`, `@radix-ui/react-icons`) are grouped by workspace.
- The CLI inspects each workspace’s `package.json` and installed versions. It only installs packages that are missing or incompatible.
- Install commands are scoped to the right workspace:
  - Workspaces with an npm package name use `npm|pnpm|yarn|bun workspace <name> add`.
  - Otherwise the command runs from the workspace root with `--dir`/`--filter` flags when supported.
- When run with `--dry-run`, the CLI reports which dependencies would be installed or updated without modifying anything.

## Summary Output
At the end of a successful run you will see:
- Files written per workspace, including the component name that produced each file.
- Ready-to-copy import statements using your project’s alias prefix.
- Lists of available variants and sizes when the registry provides them.
- Dependency actions (installed, updated, already satisfied) per workspace.

## Monorepo Behaviour
- Linked shared UI workspaces receive the shared component files (and dependency installs) automatically.
- Application workspaces typically only get integration shims or route-specific files; the bulk of the component source lives in the shared package.
- The command honours the same linking rules that `init` recorded in `nocta.config.json` and `nocta.workspace.json`.

## Dry Runs & Automation
- `--dry-run` is ideal for CI or code review. It prints everything that would happen and exits with success without touching files.
- Combine dry runs with `git diff --stat` to preview changes before committing.

## Troubleshooting
- **Component not found** – Run `npx @nocta-ui/cli list` to confirm the canonical component name.
- **Workspace unresolved** – Ensure linked workspaces are defined in `nocta.config.json` and that the relative `config` paths are correct.
- **Dependency conflicts** – Resolve manual overrides in your `package.json` if you want to keep a different version; re-run `add` afterwards to ensure compatibility.
- **Command aborted mid-run** – The CLI snapshots every overwritten file and restores the previous content automatically if an error occurs, so partial installs won't delete custom code.

Repeat the command any time you need to scaffold new components or refresh existing ones with the latest registry updates.
